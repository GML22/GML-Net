# GML-Net
<p align="justify">
The GML-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on U-Net architecture with an encoder derived from the ResNet family and BottleNeck blocks that provide reading and aggregation of feature maps from a cross-section of various scales.

The GML-Net was developed to address the problem of detecting buildings in RGB aerial images. It was trained on <i>Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset</i> (https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling) achiving 96.23% of Overall Acuurency (1.02% behind State of Art) and 74.42% of Intersecion over Union (6.64% behind SoA) - detailed leaderboard of <i>Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset</i> contest is available at: https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/leaderboard.

Effective network learning of GML-Net was ensured by loss function defined as a weighted sum of Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE), Dice Loss (DL) and Lov√°sz hinge Loss (LHL) according to formula:
